  Geo tag is a game to test your knowledge about american cities and states
  It plays something like this. Geo Tag will say name of city like Los Angeles and you have to say name of a city or state starting witht he last alphabet.
  Since last alphabet here is n, you would say something like Nebraska
  Then GeoTag will say a city or state, starting from A, say Atlanta
  Words said by either of us can not be repeated
  Score is kept for maximum number of such tags played in 30 seconds
  If you want to learn about a place the Geo Tag said you can just say tell me about it
  Or if you want to learn about a city or state in US, you can say something like tell me about Miami
  If you do not have a response, you can say pass in which case Geo Tag will start with some another word
  To start the game, just say Lets play!
